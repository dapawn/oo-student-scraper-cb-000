Scraper
  #scrape_index_page
    is a class method that scrapes the student index page and a returns an array of hashes in which each hash represents one student (FAILED - 1)
  #scrape_profile_page
    is a class method that scrapes a student's profile page and returns a hash of attributes describing an individual student
    can handle profile pages without all of the social links

Student
  #new
    takes in an argument of a hash and sets that new student's attributes using the key/value pairs of that hash.
    adds that new student to the Student class' collection of all existing students, stored in the `@@all` class variable. (FAILED - 2)
  .create_from_collection
    uses the Scraper class to create new students with the correct name and location. (FAILED - 3)
  #add_student_attributes
    uses the Scraper class to get a hash of a given students attributes and uses that hash to set additional attributes for that student. (FAILED - 4)
  .all
    returns the class variable @@all (FAILED - 5)
